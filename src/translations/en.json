After its removal from ESL, we kept the scene alive through occasional offline tournaments held once or twice a year. Today, as VietcongHub.eu, we are once again opening the space for competitive play â not only for seasoned veterans but also for newcomers who want to experience what Vietcong is all about. Our goal is to revive the community, promote fair play, and involve new players in tournaments within the framework of MÄRVC â the Czech Championship in Vietcong.",

  "app.containers.AboutUs.bambi": "Eva is a charming blonde who effortlessly shatters every clichÃ© about women of her hair color â with wit, intelligence, and an incredible feel for the game. Her strength lies in writing sharp, witty texts that entertain, hit just the right nerves, and still somehow manage not to offend. She has the rare talent of saying everything straight â in a way that makes you thank her for it. Sheâs from Brno, but unlike hhacker, she actually knows the local slang inside out. In Vietcong, she made a rocket-fast rise and started giving even the seasoned veterans a run for their money â so much so that a few years ago, the feared team iW!M recruited her into their lineup, where she shone at the last MÄRVC. Itâs no surprise her skills are in demand â her calendar is packed with more tournaments than beauty appointments, and sheâs already booked for six upcoming events. In short: a gaming talent with a sharp tongue â and an even sharper aim.",

As a developer, he started more as an eager explorer, but with every commit heâs growing, even he's learning with the intensity of someone constantly pushing uphill. At times he might feel like a pulled handbrake, but his teammates still appreciate him â because without him, this train probably wouldn't have left the station at all. Heâs been playing Vietcong since 2007, but made his mark a few years later. His longest stays were with Free Secret and later with the legendary uNik0rn, with whom he won the last three MÄRVC titles in a row. Away from the keyboard, youâll most likely find him in the gym or in running shoes â as a fan of combat sports and an active lifestyle, he knows that being in top shape comes in handy not just at LAN parties.",

His code is clean, thoughtful, and powerful â unlike his Brno slang, which sometimes even he doesnât fully understand. Heâs been playing Vietcong since the dawn of time â specifically since 2004. Since then, heâs found success in online gaming and has also taken part in several offline tournaments, earning a spot among the original legends. After a long break, he returned to this classic as if no time had passed â and immediately reminded everyone that old-school skill never fades. His greatest success came with the team LvS, which commanded respect (and occasionally mild panic) from opponents even before the match had started.",

As the captain of the legendary team RotS (Riders on the Storm), he was a nightmare for opponents for years and a symbol of tournament dominance. He loves this game and lives for it â and thanks to him, the website looks and works exactly as it should.
